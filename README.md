# How to work's my personal portfolio project?

## BIO: Hi, my name is Mikhail Zigberman.  I am studying at the Czech Technical University with a degree in Applied Informatics.  I wanted to make a portfolio site in order to post my projects here (laboratory work, term papers, etc.).  That's why I wrote this site.  The site is written in Django 3.1 and MySQL.
